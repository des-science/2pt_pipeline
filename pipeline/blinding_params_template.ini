; This is a template file that is referenced by blind_2pt_usingcosmosis.py
;   It is used as a template for running cosmosis to generate
;   blinding factors to be applied to 2pt data vectors. To adapt
;   for a specific pipeline:
;   1. Edit the %include params.ini line to point towards your baseline pipeline file.
;   2. The values file should be edited to match your fiducial run. Since we want
;      to blind sigma8, sigma8_input needs to be in the cosmological parameters,
;      so it may need to be a values file written specifically for blinding. You could
;      always set it up to %include your standard values file though.
;      >> the start values for each parameter is what will be used as reference vals
;         when generating the blinding factors. 
;   3. Make sure the file in 2PT_FILE points to a file with the format expected by
;      your pipeline (with the same binning, etc.)
;   4. The modules list in [pipeline] should match your standard pipeline with a one
;      addition: you need sigma8_rescale to be able to include sigma8_input as a parameter
